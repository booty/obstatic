  <h1>OtakuBooty.com</h1>

  <p>
    OB was important to many. I'd like to document its history. I hope it may offer some closure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many folks have asked me (often, berated me) about various decisions in the site's history over the years. I've always done my best to answer them. This has been nearly a complete waste of effort. I answer a question in one place, two or three people see it, and then I answer it all over again weeks or years later in some other place.
  </p>

  <p>
    This isn't our members' fault. Spaces like Facebook threads and web forums are pathologically unsuitable for coherent discussion. This is an alternative. As many answers as I can provide in one place.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'll be starting with easy topics and working my way up to harder topics. It may take days, months, or years before this is "complete." If you're wondering why some particular trivial thing has been addressed but not some other thing that matters to you, this is why.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't expect anybody to read this enormous document.
  </p>

  <p>
    I truly regret creating OB. As of August 2022, I will have no further interaction with any members of the OB community. Removing myself is the least I can do, aside from apologizing and accepting as much responsibility as humanly possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Update, 8/15/2022.</b> 3,300 words. 18 years of history compressed into several hours of writing, or approximatly 15 minutes of reading. There's a lot more that needs to be addressed. However, I'll probably pause on this for a while besides tweaking grammar and minor edits.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="what_was_ob">What Was OtakuBooty.com?</a></h2>

  <p>
    OB was an early attempt at a dating / social networking site. We were operational from early 2004 to roughly 2015. The site persisted in a semibroken, mostly read-only mode from 2015 to 2022.
  </p>

  <p>
    27,215 accounts created. 6,483 of them bought memberships. 123 of them were gifted lifetime membership status. I was owner and operator.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="transparency_excuses">Transparency vs. Excuses</a></h2>

  <p>
    OB's members deserve transparency. They deserve to know:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>What decisions were made</li>
    <li>Why those decisions were made</li>
    <li>Why the alternatives, if any, were discarded</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    It is difficult to describe a decision-making process without accusations of "making excuses" from those who disagree with the decisions that were made. I accept this as a fact of life.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="beginnings_i">Beginnings, Part I</h2>

  <p>
    I was a fan of anime and gaming culture in the 1980s and 1990s. Starting in 1999, I began attending anime conventions like Otakon. There was a burgeoning social scene of sorts. Many folks are lucky enough to have that moment where they find "their people" and this was mine.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the early 2000s I attempted to use some early matchmaking sites like Match.com and the results were <i>so</i> bad. I thought to myself, "I can't do worse than that." It seemed to me that folks in a particular subculture might like to meet folks from the same subculture. I decided to make a site for "my" people.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="beginnings_ii">Beginnings, Part II</a></h2>

  <p>
    The first pre-launch iteration of OB was just profiles. You created a profile. You could search for other peoples' profiles and respond to them. That was how Match.com and its ilk worked. Like personal ads in the newspapers 100 years ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    Friends beta tested it circa 2003. They told me it felt boring and lonely. There was an idea to add member forums so a community could flourish. I was worried about the kind of community it would attract. If I was going to put my heart into this concept, I decided it had to be a community I was proud of.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2004 I opened OB up to the world.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="beginnings_iii">Beginnings, Part III</a></h2>

  <p>
    Initially the site was free for everybody. From the start I made it clear that we planned to transition to a paid business at some point, so folks wouldn't feel like they were bait-and-switched later.
  </p>

  <p>
    I decided that the site needed to be funded almost entirely by member payments. This would give us freedom from advertising and attempts to appease our corporate sponsors.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wasn't into their forums but I was inspired by SomethingAwful.com's forum registration fee. It gave me confidence that folks might actually pay money for something like OB.These were the early days of the internet, when it wasn't clear that people would ever really pay for anything, so that was kind of a big deal.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2006, I started charging money. $4 a month, or $20 per year was the price I eventually settled on.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="otakubooty">The Name "OtakuBooty"</a></h2>

  <p>
    The name sucks. Everybody hated the name. I hated it. I felt it was too late to change it once we started rolling.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku">Otaku</a> is a Japanese word that means something close to "nerd," "geek," or "obsessive hobbyist." Outside of Japan, it's typically used to refer to fans of Japanese animation or video games. This was initially our target audience.
  </p>

  <p>
    "John Booty" or "Booty" is a nickname I've had since high school, when a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=philadelphia+eagles+john+booty">man named John Booty</a> played for the Philadelphia Eagles. It's funny because "booty" can also mean "butt."
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="bootycon">Bootycon</a></h2>

  <p>
    Between 2007 and 2013 our community organized annual gatherings called "Bootycon." "Bootycon 2007", "Bootycon 2008", etc. "Booty" from the name of the site (see above) and "Con" as short for "Convention" as a play on common convention names such as "Comicon" etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    To cut to the chase: these were not sex parties if that's what the reader is wondering. That may seem like an odd assertion to make but it's what some have wondered. Given the name, confusion is understandable.
  </p>

  <p>
    As with many aspects of OB, the name "Bootycon" was a joke. It was a parody, it was inside humor. These were member-only events so there was no need to make the name sensical or palatable to anybody else.
  </p>

  <p>
    Community members chaired these events. I helped as much as possible. I'm terrible at event planning so I functioned in a support role while the community took the lead. They did an amazing job. Lots of pictures of these online. We enjoyed beaches, dining outings, etc together.
  </p>

  <p>
    These gatherings took place in locations such as Virginia Beach, Myrtle Beach, Marina Del Rey, Atlantic City, and <s>Las Vegas</s> Henderson. Attendance ranged from approximately 70 to 120 members depending on the year. I absolutely enjoyed meeting our members in person. I deeply appreciated that they choose to spend a vacation with us. You only get a limited number of trips and vacations in your life.
  </p>


  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="relationships">Relationships</a></h2>

  <p>
    Many people found friends, dates, and partners on OB. Some people married. Some had children. Members were gracious enough to thank me for this sometimes. It always made me incredibly happy when people connected with each other.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was never worthy of any of those thanks. I told them I could never take credit for such things, because then I'd have to take the blame for all the breakups and divorces as well. There were a lot of those, too. And worse. A lot of pain in general. In the end, we definitely didn't make the world a better place. Probably made it much worse.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="perspective">Perspective</a></h2>

  <p>
    OB's history spanned nearly twenty years, six continents, and twenty-seven thousand members. I doubt anybody saw more than 1% of what happened. None of us experienced the same 1%.
  </p>

  <p>
    My 1% was different than yours. I experienced OB from a privileged prespective. Memebers nearly always treated me amazingly well. They behaved around me. Most other members had drastically different experiences. Many were good. Some were horrible, even traumatic.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="parties">Parties</a></h2>

  <p>
    OB members loved to get together. There were a lot of parties, often at conventions. Depending on who you ask, they were either wild and out of control... or rather tame.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was in my mid 20s by the time OB launched. Prior, I'd attended various parties in high school, college, and random twentysomething gatherings. By these standards I would call OB's parties typical in terms of debauchery. Twenty people attend a party, twelve of them are drinking, one guy drinks too much, a few couples sneak off and make out at various points. I always had a good time, sometimes a great time. I was always thankful. A lot of people never find "their" people, but I found mine.
  </p>

  <p>
    Others had horrific experiences or were simply overwhelmed because they'd never really been to a party before. Some OB parties truly were wild, or so I heard. I never witnessed anything too crazy. I guess it all depends on what your standard of crazy is.
  </p>

  <p>
    Anime and gaming conventions were natural ad-hoc gathering spaces for OB members. In general, cons were lousy places to have parties. Everybody thought they missed the good parties at cons. The reality at most cons is that parties generally get shut down fast by security once they got past ten or so people. Folks would wander from room to room at cons, never really enjoying where they were at, imagining that the <i>truly</i> raging party might be just another hotel room door away.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="safety_i">Safety, Part I</a></h2>

  <p>
    Safety-related decisions are a series of hard realities, limitations, and compromises.
  </p>

  <p>
    Those of you with kids, do you make them wear seltbelts in the car? Hopefully. But do you make them wear crash helmets? Wouldn't that be safer? Do you keep a fire extinguisher in the car? Survival tools in the car? A hammer to break the car windows in case you wind up under water and can't open the doors? Emergency food rations? Snakebite antivenom? Few would answer "yes" to all of those. You make compromises.
  </p>

  <p>
    An OB member who was formally the chairperson of a well-known gaming convention told me (paraphrasing, here) that settling for "good enough" safety wasn't okay. I had to laugh. I asked him if his staff searched every bag at his convention, checked the IDs of every attendee, or even bothered to check any of the thousands of open alcohol containers in attendees' hands as they strolled the convention to make sure they weren't being carried by underage members. Dozens if not hundreds of incidents of sexual assault and harrassment have been reported at this convention over the years.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fact is, most (including me) agree he did an outstanding job running that convention. I admire and look up to him. He worked within the limits of what was possible given the available resources (a volunteer staff outnumbered by the attendees probably 100:1) to create the safest possible environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Safest possible environment" doesn't mean "zero risk."
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="safety_ii">Safety, Part II</a></h2>

  <p>
    The level of safety OB achieved can and should be scrutinized.
  </p>

  <p>
    It makes me sick that we were unable to achieve perfect safety. The fact that <em>anybody</em> was ever hurt makes me ill. As I said (far) above, I wish I'd never created OB.
  </p>

  <p>
    The logical side of my brain says that we're talking about a group of 27,000 people interacting with each other over the course of 18 years and incidents will happen. My heart tells me that some people were hurt, and I'm a stain on the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately the question is: was OB safer than the other spaces navigated by our members? School? Other online communities? Clubs? Conventions? Dating? <i>Life?</i> How do the rates of incidents on OB compare to the rates of incidents in those spaces?
  </p>

  <p>
    I'll be sick for the rest of my life because I just don't know. If this document seems somewhat schizophrenic, bouncing between "OB was a terrible mistake" and "we all tried our best to be as safe as we could" -- yes, that's an accurate representation of my thoughts on the matter.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="decision_process">OB's Decision-Making Process</a></h2>

  <p>
    The ultimate responsibility for all decisions on OB rests with me.
  </p>

  <p>
    In nearly all situations I relied heavily on some or all of the 143 volunteer moderators when making decisions. The feedback of non-moderator members was also taken seriously. After all, the idea was to create a website and community that people liked and enjoyed.
  </p>

  <p>
    I selected the moderators. Often as a result of suggestions and nominations by other members. I also chose many moderators without consulting the others. Sometimes even without consulting the person I'd selected to be a moderator. If a person <i>asked</i> to be a moderator, I tended to rule them out. You don't want to be governed strictly by the sorts of people who want power.
  </p>

  <p>
    I tried to avoid an echo chamber or collection of "yes people" and intentionally chose many moderators that would disagree with me and challenge me. Some of the moderators drove me insane with contrary opinions but I felt it was one sign of a healthy discussion process. Did we avoid an echo chamber? Sometimes yes, often no.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moderators were never required to do anything. It was just a set of additional features they could use if desired.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="mod_problems">Problems With Moderation</a></h2>

  <p>
    To generalize, the moderators were extremely hardworking volunteers who cared deeply about the community. The community benefitted immensely thanks to their hard work. Any problems with moderation are the result of the system I devised, not the moderators' fault. Remember: some of them didn't even ask to be moderators.
  </p>

  <p>
    The moderator-only forum was infamous. Other members saw it as a shadowy cabal. In reality, it was often totally dormant or simply boring. The vast majority of the activity in the mod forum consisted of me bouncing ideas off of the moderators, or moderators exchanging intel on community issues such as members who might need to be removed for creepy or harrassing behavior. This sort of discussion is difficult to do in public.
  </p>

  <p>
    The "shadowy cabal" reputation was a problem. In hindsight I wish I'd figured out a way to make the system more transparent. Perhaps there could have been two types of moderators. Permanent, hand-selected moderators. And randomly selected temporary moderators who served one-month terms. Or something like that. I should have found a way for the community at large to be more involved in the process.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of our moderators were toxic. As is often the case with toxic people who attain positions of influence, they had significant positive traits as well. It can be difficult to recognize a person's toxidity until it's too late. I deeply apologize to members who were hurt by them. In some cases I allowed them into my life and they hurt me deeply as well.
  </p>

  <p>
    There was an incident where moderators made fun of a member's private pictures. I have no memory of this incident but believe the person who told me. This was unacceptable and I accept responsibility.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="age_limits_i">Age Limits, Part I</a></h2>

  <p>
    The goal was safety, as much of it as I could manage. It's fair to criticize decisions made or results achieved, but those doing so should consider the alternatives or lack thereof.
  </p>

  <p>
    The most difficult and most controversial decision I made involved age limits on the site.
  </p>

  <p>
    In an ideal world I would have restricted the site to 18+ or 21+. Unfortunately, OB didn't exist in an ideal world. It existed in the 2000s, when there was no practical way to verify anybody's age on the internet. Remember, the standard practice at this time for online age-restricted spaces at this time was literally "just ask the website user if they're 18 or not."
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="age_limits_ii">Age Limits, Part II</a></h2>

  <p>
    Here's a relatively common occurence: a person meets somebody from an "18+" hookup app (Tinder, Grindr, etc) with the expectation that everybody on the app is actually 18. They flirt with people under that assumption, treating them as adults. They have sex with one of those people under that assumption. That person turns out to be a minor, which means a statuatory rape has occurred. The older person is (hopefully) caught and convicted. They are now a registered sex offender. The other person is a rape survivor.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've personally known at least two people in that situation: a coworker and a family member.
  </p>

  <p>
    I damn sure wanted to avoid that with OB. I viewed that as the most dangerous possible situation imaginable. How can minors be protected if nobody knows they're minors?
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="age_limits_iii">Age Limits, Part III</a></h2>

  <p>
    The compromise I implemented was as follows. Folks under 18 could sign up for the site, but many/most of the site's features were disabled or restricted.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Posts marked 18+ were hidden and inaccessible</li>
    <li>Threads marked 18+ were hidden and inaccessible</li>
    <li>Forums marked 18+ were hidden and inaccessible</li>
    <li>Adult-themed profile comments were disabled</li>
    <li>Friends-only pictures (often used for racy photos) were disabled</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    I'm not sure how many of our 18+ members knew how restricted the site was for under-18 members. After all: if you were over 18 you never saw the restricted version of the site. The goal was for members under 18 to have a PG-13 experience on the site.
  </p>

  <p>
    All member profiles and public profile pictures required moderator approval before they could be shown to other users. Nudity and adult content were not allowed in profiles and public profile pictures, regardless of age.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="safety_hindsight">Safety in Hindsight</a></h2>

  <p>
    Here are some things I wish I'd had the chance to implement. Some of these things may sound obvious in 2022 but were technically impossible, exceeded our meager resources, or simply hadn't been done before in the early 2000s.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Reliable age verification.
    </li>
    <li>
      Paid full-time content moderation. Unfortunately, OB's revenue never supported a fulltime employee.
    </li>
    <li>
      Additional age restrictions on messaging, profile viewing, etc. If there was an age gap of more than N years between members, contact might have been restricted even further.
    </li>
    <li>
      Automated flagging of suspicious user behavior patterns. This is a complicated and ambitious task, something tech giants like Facebook struggle with given effectively unlimited engineering resources.
    </li>
    <li>
      Probably a lot more... that I'll continue to add to this list.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="humor">Humor on OB</a></h2>

  <p>
    Racial slurs were never tolerated. At least we got that right. In the early days we got nearly everything else wrong.
  </p>

  <p>
    The prevailing sense of humor initially included much that was typical of the "edgy" internet humor of the late 90s / early 2000s internet. We used many words that haven't been considered acceptable for a long time. Being par for the course was no excuse. I take full responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    This changed significantly for the better circa 2009. I thank the members who helped me to see the error of our ways.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="goals_unfulfilled">Goals, Unfulfilled</a></h2>

  <p>
    Broadly speaking, here were OB's financial goals.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Make something people will actually pay for.</li>
    <li>Turn a consistent profit.</li>
    <li>Make enough money to pay a single fulltime employee: myself.</li>
    <li>Make enough money to hire additional employees such as community managers, content managers, etc.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    I stalled out between goals 2 and 3. There were a few years where OB's revenue barely cleared the poverty line in our area but this would not have paid my rent, bills, etc. by itself. I supplemented my income by juggling contract work with OB responsibilities. I wore all hats for OB: software development, community management, marketing, and so on. This was grueling and unsustainable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually other factors changed in my life. I was unable to spend as much time running OB as I previously did. The site's revenue declined as did other subjective measures of quality.
  </p>

  <p>
    Had I been able to grow OB just a bit farther, I am confident I could have grown it a lot farther. Think about how far OB progressed without a single fulltime employee. Think about how far it might have progressed <i>with</i> a fulltime employee.
  </p>

  <p>
    This used to haunt me. How I wished I'd cleared that hurdle. Now that I consider OB a mistake, I guess we all dodged a bullet.
