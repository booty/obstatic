  <h1>OtakuBooty.com</h1>

  <p>
    OB was important to many. I'd like to document its history. I hope it may offer some closure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many folks have asked me (often, berated me) about various decisions in the site's history over the years. I've always done my best to answer them. This has been nearly a complete waste of effort. I answer a question in one place, two or three people see it, and then I answer it all over again weeks or years later in some other place.
  </p>

  <p>
    Spaces like Facebook threads and web forums in general are pathologically unsuitable for coherent discussion. This document is meant as an alternative to that. As many answers as I can provide in one place.
  </p>

  <p>
    In general I'll be starting with easy topics and working my way up to harder topics. It may take days, months, or years before this is "complete." If you're wondering why some particular trivial thing has been addressed but not some other thing that matters, this is why.
  </p>

  <p>
    I don't expect anybody to read this enormous document.
  </p>

  <p>
    I truly regret creating OB. As of August 2022, I will have no further interaction with any members of the OB community. Removing myself is the least I can do, aside from apologizing and accepting as much responsibility as humanly possible.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="what_was_ob">What Was OtakuBooty.com?</a></h2>

  <p>
    OB was an early attempt at a dating / social networking site. We were operational from early 2004 to roughly 2015. The site persisted in a semibroken, mostly read-only mode from 2015 to 2022.
  </p>

  <p>
    About 27,215 folks joined. 6,483 of them bought memberships and 123 of them were gifted lifetime membership status. I was the owner and operator.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="transparency_excuses">Transparency vs. Excuses</a></h2>

  <p>
    OB's members deserve transparency. They deserve to know:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>What decisions were made</li>
    <li>Why those decisions were made</li>
    <li>Why the alternatives, if any, were discarded</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    It is difficult to describe a decision-making process without accusations of "making excuses" from those who disagree with the decisions that were made. I accept this as a fact of life. I will err on the side of transparency regardless. I value transparency more than I value freedom from being called names.

  <h2><a name="beginnings_i">Beginnings, Part I</h2>

  <p>
    I was a fan of anime and gaming culture in the 1980s and 1990s. Starting in 1999, I began attending anime conventions like Otakon. There was a burgeoning social scene of sorts. Many folks are lucky enough to have that moment where they find "their people" and this was mine.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the early 2000s I attempted to use some early matchmaking sites like Match.com and the results were <i>so</i> bad. I thought to myself, "I can't do worse than that." It seemed to me that folks in a particular subculture might like to meet folks from the same subculture. I decided to make a site for "my" people.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="beginnings_ii">Beginnings, Part II</a></h2>

  <p>
    Originally, pre-launch, the site was just profiles. That was how Match.com and its ilk worked. Sort of like personal ads in the newspapers 100 years ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    Friends beta tested it circa 2003. They told me it felt boring and lonely. There was an idea to add member forums so a community could flourish. I was worried about the sort of community it would attract. If I was going to put my heart into this concept, I decided it had to be a community I was proud of.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2004 we opened up to the world.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="beginnings_iii">Beginnings, Part III</a></h2>

  <p>
    Initially the site was free for everybody. I made it clear that we planned to transition to a paid business at some point, so folks wouldn't feel like they were bait-and-switched later.
  </p>

  <p>
    I decided that the site needed to be funded almost entirely by member payments. This would give us freedom from advertising and attempts to appease our corporate sponsors.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wasn't into their forums but I was inspired by SomethingAwful.com's forum registration fee. It gave me confidence that folks might actually pay money for something like OB.These were the early days of the internet, when it wasn't clear that people would ever really pay for anything, so that was kind of a big deal.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2006, I started charging money. $4 a month, or $20 per year was the price I eventually settled on.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="otakubooty">The Name "OtakuBooty"</a></h2>

  <p>
    The name sucks. Everybody hated the name. I hated it. I felt it was too late to change it once we started rolling.
  </p>

  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otaku">Otaku</a> is a Japanese word that means something close to "nerd," "geek," or "obsessive hobbyist." Outside of Japan, it's typically used to refer to fans of Japanese animation or video games. This was initially our target audience.
  </p>

  <p>
    "John Booty" or "Booty" is a nickname I've had since high school, when a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=philadelphia+eagles+john+booty">man named John Booty</a> played for the Philadelphia Eagles. It's funny because "booty" can also mean "butt."
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="relationships">Relationships</a></h2>

  <p>
    Over the years, many people found friends, dates, and partners on OB. Some people married. Some had children. Members were gracious enough to thank me for this sometimes. It always made me incredibly happy when people connected with each other.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was never worthy of any of those thanks. I told them I could never take credit for such things, because then I'd have to take the blame for all the breakups and divorces as well. There were a lot of those, too. And worse. A lot of pain in general. In the end, we definitely didn't make the world a better place. Probably made it much worse.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="perspective">Perspective</a></h2>

  <p>
    OB's history spanned nearly twenty years, six continents, and twenty-seven thousand members. I doubt anybody saw more than 1% of what happened and even more crucially none of us experienced the same 1%.
  </p>

  <p>
    My 1% was different than yours. I experienced OB from a privileged prespective. Memebers nearly always treated me amazingly well. Most other members had drastically different experiences. Many were good. Some were horrible, even traumatic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Out of necessity, I'm writing all of this from <i>my</i> perspective. I will work hard to be mindful of others' experiences in an explicit way.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="parties">Parties</a></h2>

  <p>
    OB members loved to get together. There were a lot of parties, often at conventions. Depending on who you asked, they were either wild and out of control or rather tame.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was in my mid 20s by the time OB launched. Prior, I'd attended various parties in high school, college, and random twentysomething gatherings. I would call OB's parties... fairly typical, in terms of debauchery levels? Twenty people attend a party, twelve of them are drinking, one guy drinks too much, a few couples sneak off and make out at various points. You know, the basic template. I always had a good time, sometimes a great time. I was always so thankful to get together with everybody. A lot of people never find "their" people, but I found mine.
  </p>

  <p>
    Others had horrific experiences, or were simply overwhelmed because they'd never really been to a party before. Some OB parties truly were wild, or so I heard. I wasn't there for anything too crazy. But I guess it depends on what your standard of crazy is.
  </p>

  <p>
    In general, cons were lousy places to have parties. Everybody thought they missed the good parties at cons. The reality at most cons is that parties generally got shut down fast by security once they got past ten or so people. Folks would wander from room to room at cons, never really enjoying where they were at, imagining that the <i>truly</i> raging party might be just another hotel room door away.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="safety_i">Safety, Part I</a></h2>

  <p>
    Safety-related decisions are a series of hard realities, limitations, and compromises.
  </p>

  <p>
    Those of you with kids, do you make them wear seltbelts in the car? Hopefully. But do you make them wear crash helmets? Wouldn't that be safer? Do you keep a fire extinguisher in the car? Survival tools in the car? A hammer to break the car windows in case you wind up under water and can't open the doors? Emergency food rations? Snakebite antivenom? Few would answer "yes" to all of those. You make compromises.
  </p>

  <p>
    An OB member who was formally the chairperson of a well-known gaming convention told me that (paraphrasing, here) that settling for "good enough" safety wasn't okay. I had to laugh. I asked him if his staff searched every bag at his convention, checked the IDs of every attendee, or even bothered to check any of the thousands of open alcohol containers in attendees' hands as they strolled the convention to make sure they weren't being carried by underage members. Dozens if not hundreds of incidents of sexual assault and harrassment have been reported at this convention over the years.
  </p>

  <p>
    The fact is, most (including me) agree he did an outstanding job running that convention. He worked within the limits of what was possible given the available resources (a volunteer staff outnumbered by the attendees probably 100:1) to create the safest possible environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    "Safest possible environment" doesn't mean "zero risk."
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="safety_ii">Safety, Part II</a></h2>

  <p>
    The level of safety OB achieved can and should be scrutinized, as should every individual decision. I invite this.
  </p>

  <p>
    It makes me sick that we were unable to achieve perfect safety. The fact that <em>anybody</em> was ever hurt makes me ill. As I said (far) above, I wish I'd never created OB.
  </p>

  <p>
    The logical side of my brain says that we're talking about a group of 27,000 people interacting with each other over the course of 18 years and incidents will happen. My heart tells me that some people were hurt, and I'm a stain on the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately the question is: was OB safer than the other spaces navigated by our members? School? Other online communities? Clubs? Conventions? Dating? <i>Life?</i> How do the rates of incidents on OB compare to the rates of incidents in those spaces?
  </p>

  <p>
    I'll be sick for the rest of my life because I just don't know.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="decision_process">OB's Decision-Making Process</a></h2>

  <p>
    The ultimate responsibility for all decisions on OB rests with me. You want somebody to blame for a decision, blame me.
  </p>

  <p>
    In nearly all situations I relied heavily on some or all of the 143 volunteer moderators when making decisions. The feedback of non-moderator members was also taken seriously. After all, the idea was to create a website and community that people liked and enjoyed.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moderators were ultimately selected by me, often as a result of suggestions and nominations by other members.
  </p>

  <p>
    I tried to avoid an echo chamber or collection of "yes people" and intentionally chose many moderators that would disagree with me and challenge me. Some of the moderators drove me insane with contrary opinions. In a similar vein, I chose many moderators <i>without</i> consulting the other mods, as a hedge against echo chamberization.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="age_limits_i">Age Limits, Part I</a></h2>

  <p>
    The goal was safety, as much of it as I could manage. It's fair to criticize the decisions made, but those wishing to do so should consider the alternatives or lack thereof.
  </p>

  <p>
    The most difficult and most controversial decision I made involved age limits on the site.
  </p>

  <p>
    In an ideal world I would have restricted the site to 18+ or 21+. Unfortunately, OB didn't exist in an ideal world. It existed in the 2000s, when there was no practical way to verify anybody's age on the internet. Remember, the standard practice at this time for online age-restricted spaces at this time was literally "just ask the website user if they're 18 or not."
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="age_limits_ii">Age Limits, Part II</a></h2>

  <p>
    Here's a relatively common occurence: a person meets somebody from an "18+" hookup app (Tinder, Grindr, etc) with the expectation that everybody on the site is actually 18. They flirt with people under that assumption, treating them as adults. They have sex with one of those people under that assumption. That person turns out to be a minor, which means a statuatory rape has occurred. The older person is (hopefully) caught and convicted. They are now a registered sex offender. The other person is a rape survivor.
  </p>

  <p>
    I've personally known two people this happened to: a coworker and a family member.
  </p>

  <p>
    I damn sure wanted to avoid that with OB. I viewed that as the most dangerous possible situation imaginable. How could minors be protected if nobody knows they're minors?
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="age_limits_iii">Age Limits, Part III</a></h2>

  <p>
    The compromise I implemented was this. Folks under 18 could sign up for the site, but many/most of the site's features were disabled or restricted.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>Posts marked 18+ were hidden and inaccessible</li>
    <li>Threads marked 18+ were hidden and inaccessible</li>
    <li>Forums marked 18+ were hidden and inaccessible</li>
    <li>Adult-themed profile comments were disabled</li>
    <li>Friends-only pictures (often used for racy photos) were disabled</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    I'm not sure how many of our 18+ members knew how restricted the site was for under-18 members. After all: if you were over 18, you never saw the restricted version of the site. The goal was for members under 18 to have a PG-13 experience on the site.
  </p>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="safety_hindsight">Safety in Hindsight</a></h2>

  <p>
    With the benefit of hindsight, here are some things I wish I'd had the chance to implement. Some of these things may sound obvious in 2022, but were technically impossible, exceeded our meager resources, or simply hadn't been done before in the early 2000s.
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Reliable age verification.
    </li>
    <li>
      Paid full-time content moderation. This was the first item on my "shopping list" once OB's revenue would support it. Unfortunately, it never did. There were only two years when OB's net revenue would have supported a single full-time employee above the poverty level, and this would not have been enough to hire skilled and reliable professionals.
    </li>
    <li>
      Additional age restrictions on messaging, profile viewing, etc. If there was an age gap of more than N years between members, contact might have been restricted even further.
    </li>
    <li>
      Automated flagging of suspicious user behavior patterns. So we could better identify issues. This may have required a full-time dedicated software engineer or something close to it.
    </li>
    <li>
      Benefit from what we know in 2022. In the past twenty years, much has been learned about how to create and govern safer online spaces. The 2000s were very much the early days of the public internet. We as an indsutry were just beginning to figure things out.
    </li>
    <li>
      Probably a lot more... that I'll continue to add to this list.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <a href="#top" class="top-link">Back to top</a>
  <h2><a name="humor">Humor on OB</a></h2>

  <p>
    Racial slurs were always insta-bannable. At least we got that right. In the early days we got nearly everything else wrong.
  </p>

  <p>
    In general, the prevailing sense of humor initially included much that was typical of the uh, "edgy" internet humor of the late 90s / early 2000s internet. We used many words that haven't been considered acceptable for a long time. This is one thing I particularly regret. Being par for the course was no excuse. I take full responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    This changed significantly for the better circa 2009. I thank the members who helped me to see the error of our ways.
