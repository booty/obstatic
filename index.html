  <p>
    OB was important to many. I'd like to document its history. I hope it may offer some closure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many folks have asked me about various decisions in the site's history over the years. I've always done my best to answer them. In general this has been a complete waste of effort. I answer a question in one place, two or three people see it, and then I answer it all over again weeks or years later in some other place.
  </p>

  <p>
    I'll likely start off with a dry factual history of OB. I realize none of that matters, even a little bit. Later I'll talk about accountability, things I wish I'd done differently, and other things that actually matter.

  <p>
    OB was an early attempt at a dating / social networking site. We were operational from early 2004 to roughly 2015. The site persisted in a semibroken, mostly read-only mode from 2015 to 2022.
  </p>

  <p>
    About 27,215 folks joined. 6,483 of them bought memberships and 123 of them were gifted lifetime membership status.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was the owner and operator. A team of moderators, picked by me, served as a cabinet or brain trust. I'll take the responsibility for all bad decisions, as the final say rested with me. Credit for any good decisions belongs with the mods and other site members who offered me valuable feedback on nearly every call I made.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was a fan of anime and gaming culture in the 1980s and 1990s. Starting in 1999, I began attending anime conventions like Otakon. There was a burgeoning social scene of sorts. Many folks are lucky enough to have that moment where they find "their people" and this was mine.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the early 2000s I attempted to use some early matchmaking sites like Match.com and the results were <i>so</i> bad. I thought to myself, "I can't do worse than that." I wasn't able to find any of "my" people on those matchmaking sites. I thought I'd make my own site.
  </p>

  <h2><a name="beginnings_ii">Beginnings, Part II</a></h2>

  <p>
    Originally, pre-launch, the site was just profiles. That was how Match.com and its ilk worked. Sort of like personal ads in the newspapers 100 years ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    Friends beta tested it circa 2003. They told me it felt boring and lonely. There was an idea to add member forums so a community could flourish. I was worried about the sort of community it would attract. If I was going to put my heart into this concept, I decided it had to be a community I was proud of.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2004 we opened up to the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    Initially the site was free for everybody. I made it clear that we planned to transition to a paid business at some point, so folks wouldn't feel like they were bait-and-switched later.
  </p>

  <p>
    I decided that the site needed to be funded almost entirely by member payments. This would give us freedom from advertising and attempts to appease our corporate sponsors.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wasn't into their forums but I was inspired by SomethingAwful.com's forum registration fee. It gave me confidence that folks might actually pay money for something like OB.These were the early days of the internet, when it wasn't clear that people would ever really pay for anything, so that was kind of a big deal.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2006, I started charing money. $4 a month, or $20 per year was the price I eventually settled on.

  <h2><a name="beginnings_iii">Relationships</a></h2>

  <p>
    Over the years, many people found friends, dates, and partners on OB. Some people married. Some had children.
  </p>

  <p>
    Members were gracious enough to thank me for this sometimes. It always made me incredibly happy when people connected with each other. But I was never worthy of any of those thanks. I told them I could never take credit for such things, because then I'd have to take the blame for all the breakups and divorces too. There were a lot of those.
